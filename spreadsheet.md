Notes from R data carpentry course

Spreadsheets:

Don't use hyphens. Will cause problems.
Keep a single cell for a single piece of information.
Leave the raw data! Don't edit it. Make a copy.

Make a text file with the steps you used to take to make the different steps.

The rule of thumb, when setting up a datasheet, is columns = variables, rows = observations, cells = data (values).

Dates are critical and how excel records dates is by numeric values. Different excels have different starting dates.

Export data.

Don't add space into names of variables or folders. Don't add slashes tooo! \ or . or starting with numbers.

KEY POINTS:
Avoid using multiple tables within one spreadsheet.

Avoid spreading data across multiple tabs.

Record zeros as zeros.

Use an appropriate null value to record missing data.

Donâ€™t use formatting to convey information or to make your spreadsheet look pretty.

Place comments in a separate column.

Record units in column headers.

Include only one piece of information in a cell.

Avoid spaces, numbers and special characters in column headers.

Avoid special characters in your data.

Record metadata in a separate plain text file.

DATES!!!!!!!!!!!

Storing dates as YEAR, MONTH, DAY

Best format is recording YEAR, MONTH and DAY in seperate columns.
Second best format: yyyy-mm-dd  in one column.

SAVE as CSV would be better. CSV won't save the formula, just the value.
